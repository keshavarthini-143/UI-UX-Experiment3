# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

The aim of this experiment is to apply heuristic evaluation of existing websites or apps and redesign them by combining features of two competing applications to improve the overall user experience.

## Problem Statement:

1.Compare and analyze the UX of two competing apps/websites.

2.Develop and incorporate required changes in the analysed apps/websites and produce an improved interface.

## Algorithm:

1.Start.

2.Select 2–3 existing apps/websites to analyse (e.g., Amazon and Instagram).

3.Apply heuristic evaluation to each app (check usability, design, navigation, etc.).

4.Note strengths and weaknesses of each app.

5.Decide which features to combine or improve.

6.Create a prototype or sketch for the new app using the chosen features.

7.Test the new design with users or peers to get feedback.

8.Refine the design based on feedback.

9.End.

## Heuristic Evaluation of Existing Apps

We analysed two well-known apps: Amazon (e-commerce) and Instagram (social media). Using Jakob Nielsen’s usability heuristics, we looked at how each app handles visibility, navigation, consistency, error prevention and overall design. Both apps give smooth experiences in their fields but differ in how they organise content, guide users and manage tasks.

## Comparison and Analysis of User Experience

Amazon gives detailed product info, secure checkout and many filters, but its homepage feels crowded with banners and offers, which can confuse new users. Instagram has a clean, attractive feed and high engagement through likes, comments and reels, but lacks direct shopping features. Amazon is stronger in transactional flow and error prevention; Instagram is stronger in simplicity, consistency and user engagement.

## Development and Incorporation of Required Changes

A new prototype was created combining the best parts of both apps. It uses Instagram’s clean feed style but shows product posts and reels, while bringing in Amazon’s shopping and checkout features with simplified categories. Clear icons and collapsible sections reduce clutter. A bottom navigation bar gives quick access to home, categories, new post, reels and profile.

## Evaluation of Design Changes

This design lets users browse and share products like posts and reels, makes navigation simpler and faster, and keeps key actions like search, view, add to cart and buy short and clear. In the future, A/B testing can measure session length, click-through rate, add-to-cart, purchase conversions and bounce rate to see how much the new design improves user experience.
## Output:

A combined mock-up or prototype of a shopping-plus-social app was created by applying heuristic evaluation insights from Amazon and Instagram.

## Result:

The new design successfully combines the transactional power of Amazon with the engagement style of Instagram, producing a cleaner and more user-friendly app.
